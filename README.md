SurroGate is a general purpose TCP-to-TCP proxy implemented in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'surro-gate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install surro-gate

## Usage

```ruby
require 'surro-gate'

proxy = SurroGate.new

# Create two TCP socket connections
left = SurroGate::Connection.new(TCPSocket.new('localhost', 3333))
right = SurroGate::Connection.new(TCPSocket.new('localhost', 2222))

# Push the sockets to the proxy
proxy.push(left, right)

# Wait for the communication to finish
proxy.wait

```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
